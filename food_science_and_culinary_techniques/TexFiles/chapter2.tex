This section of the course notes is designed to streamline access to the key findings from each reading material (RM), providing a concise and accessible overview of essential information. Created through experimentation with various AI platforms, this chapter also serves to enhance my prompt engineering skills, exploring diverse methods of note-taking for maximum efficiency and clarity. The procedures for creating these summaries have varied, but all methods share a common approach: each RM has been fully read, with summaries and notes prepared after completing each respective subsection. By using these AI-co-op'ed approaches, these notes aim to be both a reliable reference and a resource for continuous improvement in capturing complex microbiology concepts.

\subsection*{Introduction}
Chemistry evolved over a millennia, merging with biology to form diverse fields like \textbf{food chemistry}, which focuses on sustenance and nutrition. This chapter outlines chemistry's relation to food sciences and its educational context, addressing challenges like increased teaching loads and exploring new opportunities \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{On the Need for Chemistry}
\textbf{Food chemistry} studies the composition, structure, and properties of food and their transformations. It builds on general chemistry, including \textbf{organic}, \textbf{physical}, and \textbf{inorganic} branches. This chapter surveys these areas and introduces key terms for future topics \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsection*{Organic Chemistry}
\textbf{Organic chemistry} focuses on carbon compounds and \textbf{covalent bonds} with hydrogen. Hydrocarbon nomenclature (e.g., \textbf{alkanes}, \textbf{alkenes}, and \textbf{alkynes}) introduces systematic naming. Topics include bonding theories, \textbf{valence}, and molecular conformation constraints \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{Functional Group Chemistry}
Organic compounds belong to families like \textbf{alkanes}, \textbf{alcohols} (R-OH), and \textbf{carboxylic acids} (R-COOH). Functional groups have consistent behaviour, e.g., \textbf{hydroxyl} groups act similarly across compounds. Their reactivity may vary with the R group, as in alcohol vs. phenol \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsubsection*{Aromatic Compounds}
\textbf{Aromaticity} in compounds like benzene involves \textbf{electron delocalisation} and resonance. Conjugated double bonds in unsaturated lipids and fat-soluble vitamins contribute to their color and oxidative sensitivity. Free radicals drive polymerization of natural monomers like \textbf{isoprene} \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsubsection*{Organic Reaction Mechanisms}
Organic reactions include \textbf{addition}, \textbf{substitution}, and \textbf{rearrangement}, often occurring in raw and processed foods. \textbf{Free radical} reactions drive polymerization and impact \textbf{lipid oxidation}, photochemical processes, and ageing-related deterioration \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsubsection*{Stereochemistry}
\textbf{Stereochemistry} studies chiral compounds, often with asymmetric carbons attached to four groups. Mole- cules with \textbf{N} stereogenic centers yield ($2^N$) stereoisomers. Chirality includes helices lacking stereogenic centers. Chiral molecules rotate plane-polarized light, but \textbf{racemic mixtures} show no net optical activity \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsection*{Physical Chemistry}
\textbf{Physical chemistry} explores material transformations, focusing on three key themes: \textbf{thermodynamics}, \textbf{chemical kinetics}, and \textbf{quantum mechanics} \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{Thermodynamics}
\textbf{Thermodynamics} examines energy forms, transformations, and efficiency. The \textbf{first law} states energy is conserved, expressed as ($U=Q+W$). The \textbf{second law} highlights entropy increase, with \textbf{Gibbs free energy} ($\Delta G $) predicting spontaneity. Applications include \textbf{reaction calorimetry} and energy content in food \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{Chemical Kinetics}
\textbf{Chemical kinetics} studies reaction rates, influenced by factors like concentration, temperature, and catalysts. Reaction rates follow Equation \ref*{eq:CK_rate}. 
\begin{equation} 
    \text{rate}=k[A]^x[B]^y
    \label{eq:CK_rate}
\end{equation}

With ($k$) described by the \textbf{Arrhenius equation}  which can be seen from Equation \ref*{eq:Arrhenius} 
\begin{equation}
    \ln k=\ln k_0- \frac{\Delta E^\#}{RT} 
    \label{eq:Arrhenius}    
\end{equation}

The \textbf{Eyring theory} relates $k$ to $\Delta G^\#$, $\Delta H^\#$, and $\Delta S^\#$, emphasizing transition states \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsection*{Inorganic Chemistry}
\textbf{Inorganic chemistry} covers non-carbon elements, including metals, nonmetals, and metalloids. Periodic trends, such as \textbf{atomic radii}, \textbf{ionization energies}, and \textbf{electronegativity}, arise from effective nuclear charge and electron shielding \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{Chemical Bonding}
\textbf{Chemical bonding} can be described with \textbf{Lewis structures} which illustrates electron sharing or transfer. The \textbf{octet rule} explains covalent bonds, while differences in electronegativity lead to polarized or ionic bonds. \textbf{Resonance} applies to compounds like nitrate, where multiple structures describe electron distribution \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{The Shapes of Molecules}
Molecular shapes are predicted using the \textbf{VSEPR model}, based on repulsions between electron pairs. Geometries like \textbf{linear}, \textbf{trigonal planar}, \textbf{tetrahedral}, and \textbf{octahedral} depend on bonded atoms and lone pairs, as seen in molecules like \textbf{$H_2O$} and \textbf{$NH_3$} \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{Valence}
\textbf{Valence-bond theory} explains covalent bonds through orbital overlap. Some valencies require \textbf{hybrid orbitals} (e.g., \textbf{$sp^1$}, \textbf{$sp^2$}, \textbf{$sp^3$}), formed via electron promotion and orbital mixing. Orbital shapes are influenced by electron repulsion \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{Molecular Orbital Theory}
\textbf{Molecular orbital theory} explains bonding via atomic orbital combinations forming equal numbers of bonding $\sigma$ and anti-bonding $\sigma^*$ orbitals. Molecular orbitals follow \textbf{Pauli's exclusion principle} and fill singly before pairing. Diatomic oxygen illustrates these principles \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsection*{Food Chemistry}
\subsubsection*{Definition and Scope}
\textbf{Food chemistry} applies chemistry principles to food systems, studying macroconstituents (e.g., \textbf{water}, \textbf{carbohydrates}) and microconstituents (e.g., \textbf{vitamins}, \textbf{additives}). Post-WWII advances improved \textbf{shelf-life}, \textbf{packaging}, and analysis of toxicants. Food sciences ensure nutritious, safe, and affordable food \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{Areas of Expertise Required by the Institute of Food Technology}
The \textbf{Institute of Food Technology} identifies five core competencies for food scientists: \textbf{chemistry}, \textbf{analysis}, \textbf{nutrition}, \textbf{microbiology}, and \textbf{engineering} \cite*{BKR_01}.

\subsubsection*{Chemistry and the Food System}
\textbf{Food chemistry} encompasses all levels of the food system, from \textbf{soil pH} in agronomy to the effects of \textbf{pasteurization}. Its scope includes \textbf{harvesting}, \textbf{processing}, \textbf{packaging}, and \textbf{distribution}, as well as studying \textbf{ingredient behaviour} during manufacture \cite*{BKR_01}.
